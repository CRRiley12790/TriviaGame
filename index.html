        I'm sorry I couldnt finish this assignment. I just had way too much going on with work.
        I was going to attempt to find code online and modify it to fit my data but I couldnt eve get that to work.
        And after the convo in class today, I am better off just admitting I just didnt have the time. 

        I have really fallen behind this week in class to the point of nearly being lost. I am going to try to catch up over the holiday.
